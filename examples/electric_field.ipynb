Suppose that a monochromatic plane wave of light is travelling in the positive $z$-direction, with angular frequency $\\omega$ and wave vector $k = (0,0,k)$, where the wavenumber $k = \\omega/c$. Then the electric and magnetic fields $E$ and $H$ are orthogonal to $k$ at each point; they both lie in the plane \"transverse\" to the direction of motion. Furthermore, $H$ is determined from $E$ by 90-degree rotation and a fixed multiplier depending on the wave impedance of the medium. So the polarization of the light can be determined by studying $E$.
